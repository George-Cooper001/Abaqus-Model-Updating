# Abaqus-Model-Updating
Selected tasks of the construction progress digital twin model.
The repository consists of three code files, a Python file and two Matlab code files. the Python code is used to process the odb and inp files generated by abaqus and to upload new tasks with new parameters to abaqus; the Matlab code focuses on processing the objective function values and updating the new parameters.
In this task, we focus only on updating the material parameters such as density and Young's modulus.
The optimisation algorithm uses the "fmincon" algorithm.
With these two code files, an automatic iteration of the task is possible. The only thing that needs to be done is to give one or more initial parameter pairs in the Matlab code.
Note: If you want to use these codes, you need to change the corresponding file paths in the code.
It is best to keep the code file and the inp file in the same directory
